# Pre-PR Checklist

Run this before pushing/opening a PR.

## Git hygiene

- [ ] Not on `main`.
- [ ] Branch is based on current `main`.
- [ ] `git status --short` contains only intended files.
- [ ] No unrelated refactors or drive-by cleanup.
- [ ] No ignored/private/local files staged.
- [ ] No co-authorship in commit message.

## Privacy/security

- [ ] No API keys, tokens, cookies, auth headers, connection strings, or secrets.
- [ ] No raw private prompts/responses/request bodies logged by default.
- [ ] Error paths do not dump sensitive payloads.
- [ ] Local files such as `AGENTS.local.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/*.local.md`, `.agents/private/` are not committed.

## llm-tracker risks

- [ ] Cost/token accounting tested if touched: `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_costs.py tests/test_pricing.py -q`.
- [ ] Provider/model normalization tested if touched: `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_provider_parser.py tests/test_config.py -q`.
- [ ] Streaming/tool-call partial chunk behavior tested if touched: `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_proxy.py tests/test_recorder.py -q`.
- [ ] Schema migration/backward compatibility tested if touched: `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_database.py tests/test_api.py -q`.
- [ ] Worker/background job DB timeout behavior considered if touched.
- [ ] Frontend-used API routes added to `frontend/vite-api-proxy.js` by editing `shouldProxyApiRequest()` explicit pathname/prefix checks, with `frontend/vite-api-proxy.test.js` updated.

## Verification

Backend touched:
